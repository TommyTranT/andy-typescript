This is notes on typescript based off Andys lecture.

# What is Typescript?
* Superset of Javascript
* All JS is valid TS
* JS with static typing

scss => sass transpiler => css

Node does not understand TS, so we need a compiler to turn it into JS
ts => typescript transpiler => js

# Benefits
* Only accepts what you tell it to accept. 
* Won't compile if what you input is not correct

# Download 
- npm i -g typescript
- tsc -v will check typescript version

# Changing the default language to ES6
- tsc 01_basics.ts --target es2016
